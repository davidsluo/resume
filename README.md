# Resume
My resume written in pure HTML and CSS. Find it at https://dsluo.me/resume.

## Why?
Microsoft Word isn't exactly version control friendly, and LaTeX wasn't worth the time investment. 
HTML + CSS allows me to put my resume in a git repository using the tools I already know and is
easily viewable (and printable) by anyone who visits.
